/* Control structures determine how the program flows. JavaScript has 2 important types of control structures; 
conditionals and loops. 

JavaScript has different kind of structures that can help in multiple situations:

Conditionals

    if / else
    switch

Loops

    for
    for..of
    for..in
    while
    do..while
    Array.forEach

*/

//An if statement is used to make a program take a route, or another, depending upon the result of an express evaluation.
//the conditional checks the expression i pass to it for a true or false value. If i pass a number, that always evaluates
//as true unless the number is 0.  If i pass a string, it always evaluates to true unless its an empty string. 
//these are rules for casting types to boolean 
if (true) {
    //do something
}
//If there is a single statement to execute after the conditionals, the block can be omitted, just write statement
if (true) (a + b)

//Else is the statement that is executed if the condition is false. 
if (true) {
    //do something
}
else {
    //do something else
}

//Else if

if (c === true) {
    //do something
}
else if(r===true){
    //do something else
}
else {
    //default
}
